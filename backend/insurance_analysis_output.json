    "Cigna recently denied my critical physical therapy claims, citing an 'algorithm' and making it impossible to get actual medical review. My treatment was essential, and now I'm facing huge bills.",
    "The premiums for our small business group plan have skyrocketed over the past two years with Cigna, making it incredibly difficult to provide affordable coverage for our employees. We're constantly looking for alternatives.",
    "Dealing with Cigna's customer service is a nightmare. Long wait times, representatives who can't answer complex questions, and constant transfers. Getting a resolution for even simple issues is a full-time job.",
    "My claim for a necessary procedure was initially denied by Cigna without explanation. After weeks of appeals and providing extensive documentation, it was finally approved, but the stress and hassle were immense.",
    "While some routine claims go through smoothly, any slightly complex or expensive medical issue seems to face immediate pushback or denial from Cigna. It feels like they're designed to make accessing care difficult."

    "My premiums with UnitedHealthcare have inexplicably surged this year, making our small business group plan almost unaffordable, despite no changes in our claims history. It feels like they just raise prices without justification.",
    "Getting treatments approved by UnitedHealthcare is a nightmare; they denied a crucial procedure our doctor recommended, citing their internal criteria, which seems arbitrary and focused on cost-cutting.",
    "The recent reports about UnitedHealthcare using AI algorithms to deny care are deeply concerning and confirm my personal experiences with constant prior authorization hurdles and delayed approvals.",
    "Dealing with UnitedHealthcare's customer service after a claim denial felt like hitting a brick wall. Long hold times, conflicting information, and no resolution insight, forcing me to appeal multiple times.",
    "While UnitedHealthcare offers a wide network, the constant battle over what they'll actually cover, combined with unexpected out-of-pocket expenses, means their 'coverage' often feels more like a facade."
