    "Cigna recently denied my critical physical therapy claims, citing an 'algorithm' and making it impossible to get actual medical review. My treatment was essential, and now I'm facing huge bills.",
    "The premiums for our small business group plan have skyrocketed over the past two years with Cigna, making it incredibly difficult to provide affordable coverage for our employees. We're constantly looking for alternatives.",
    "Dealing with Cigna's customer service is a nightmare. Long wait times, representatives who can't answer complex questions, and constant transfers. Getting a resolution for even simple issues is a full-time job.",
    "My claim for a necessary procedure was initially denied by Cigna without explanation. After weeks of appeals and providing extensive documentation, it was finally approved, but the stress and hassle were immense.",
    "While some routine claims go through smoothly, any slightly complex or expensive medical issue seems to face immediate pushback or denial from Cigna. It feels like they're designed to make accessing care difficult."

    "• **Automated Claim Denials Controversy:** In February 2024, ProPublica and STAT News reported that Cigna used an automated system, the PxDx tool, and employed two doctors to deny hundreds of thousands of claims within a month without individual patient file review, leading to widespread consumer outcry and potential legal action.",
    "• **Lawsuits over Denials:** Following reports of automated denials, Cigna has faced a wave of new class-action lawsuits alleging that the company unlawfully denied medically necessary care by using algorithms instead of proper medical review.",
    "• **Consistent Customer Service Complaints:** Across various review platforms, customers frequently report long wait times, difficulty reaching knowledgeable representatives, and frustrating processes for resolving billing errors or denied claims.",
    "• **Rising Premiums and Out-of-Pocket Costs:** Many policyholders, particularly small business owners like yourself, express frustration over continuous premium increases and high deductibles, co-pays, and co-insurance, which can lead to significant out-of-pocket expenses even with coverage."
