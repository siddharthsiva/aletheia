        "My premiums with UnitedHealthcare have inexplicably surged this year, making our small business group plan almost unaffordable, despite no changes in our claims history. It feels like they just raise prices without justification.",
        "Getting treatments approved by UnitedHealthcare is a nightmare; they denied a crucial procedure our doctor recommended, citing their internal criteria, which seems arbitrary and focused on cost-cutting.",
        "The recent reports about UnitedHealthcare using AI algorithms to deny care are deeply concerning and confirm my personal experiences with constant prior authorization hurdles and delayed approvals.",
        "Dealing with UnitedHealthcare's customer service after a claim denial felt like hitting a brick wall. Long hold times, conflicting information, and no resolution insight, forcing me to appeal multiple times.",
        "While UnitedHealthcare offers a wide network, the constant battle over what they'll actually cover, combined with unexpected out-of-pocket expenses, means their 'coverage' often feels more like a facade."
