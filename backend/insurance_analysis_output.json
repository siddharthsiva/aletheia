    "Finding comprehensive health coverage with pre-existing conditions was daunting, but a marketplace plan offered manageable out-of-pocket costs, which was a huge relief.",
    "The mobile app and 24/7 support are game-changers for my busy freelance schedule. I can manage policies and get quick answers anytime, anywhere.",
    "After a previous denial, transparency was my top priority. This provider has been upfront about all costs and policy terms, which builds a lot of trust.",
    "While their health insurance is excellent, I had to secure my renters policy separately. It would be convenient to bundle, but the quality of each coverage makes it worthwhile.",
    "Customer service can sometimes have long wait times, but when I connect with a representative, they are usually very knowledgeable and helpful, especially with complex medical inquiries."
