    "Our mental health claims have been repeatedly denied by UnitedHealthcare, forcing us to pay thousands out of pocket, despite having 'comprehensive' coverage. This is unacceptable and has caused immense stress.",
    "Premiums for our group health plan have skyrocketed with UnitedHealthcare this year, making it incredibly difficult for our small business to provide affordable benefits. The lack of transparency on these increases is appalling.",
    "The customer service for UnitedHealthcare is a nightmare. After the Change Healthcare cyberattack, it became nearly impossible to get claims processed, and speaking to a competent representative takes hours.",
    "We chose UnitedHealthcare for its wide network, but accessing care feels like a constant battle against denials and bureaucratic hurdles. The 'coverage' they offer often feels illusory when you actually need it.",
    "After years with UnitedHealthcare, we've encountered unexplained price hikes and inconsistent policy enforcement. We're actively looking for an insurer that prioritizes its customers over its bottom line."

    "UnitedHealthcare is the largest health insurer in the United States, a subsidiary of the larger UnitedHealth Group. It offers a wide range of health benefit plans and services to individuals, employers, and Medicare/Medicaid beneficiaries.",
    "• UnitedHealthcare has faced numerous lawsuits and regulatory actions concerning alleged wrongful denials of claims, particularly for mental health and substance use disorder treatments, leading to significant fines and public outcry.",
    "• As the parent company of Change Healthcare, UnitedHealth Group was at the center of a massive cyberattack in early 2024, which severely disrupted claims processing and payments across the entire U.S. healthcare system, causing widespread chaos and financial strain for providers and patients alike.",
    "• Policyholders frequently report unexplained and substantial premium increases, alongside a lack of transparency regarding billing practices and out-of-pocket costs.",
    "• The company consistently receives low customer satisfaction ratings, with common complaints citing excessively long wait times, unhelpful customer service representatives, and significant administrative hurdles in processing claims and resolving disputes."
